How the release asset works
This repository hosts a releases page where you can download prebuilt assets. The releases page includes installers and package bundles suitable for quick startup. The latest release asset provides a ready-to-run version of the app that you can install or unzip. The asset is named to reflect the project and platform, and you should pick the one that matches your OS. For the latest stable setup, visit the releases page and download the file named Sukhdebpatra-ReactDeveloper-Setup.exe (or the corresponding macOS/Linux variants). The asset is designed to install the app with a single run, so you can explore features immediately after setup.

If you prefer to explore the code first, you can still start from source. The Releases page serves as a fast path to a runnable version, while the source code in this repository shows the components and the data flow in detail. The link used for the releases page is the one you can rely on for downloads. See the link at the top of this document for quick access to the latest asset.

Quick start: download and install
- Step 1: Open the releases page at the link above.
- Step 2: Find the latest release and download the primary setup asset for your platform. The file is named something like Sukhdebpatra-ReactDeveloper-Setup.exe for Windows.
- Step 3: Run the installer. If you see a security prompt, allow the program to install.
- Step 4: Launch the app after the installation completes. The app opens with a multi-select theme interface and a basic demo dataset.
- Step 5: Use the UI to select multiple items. Toggle themes with the theme switcher to see how colors and tokens adapt.
- Step 6: If you want to inspect code, you can clone the repository and run from source. The source contains all components and utilities used in the app.

Quick start: run from source
- Prerequisites: Node.js (>=14.x) and npm or yarn. A modern IDE helps, but a text editor works too.
- Step 1: Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/Navaneeth13055/Sukhdebpatra-ReactDeveloper.git
- Step 2: Install dependencies
  - npm install
  - or yarn install
- Step 3: Start the dev server
  - npm start
  - or yarn start
- Step 4: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- Step 5: Explore features as you would in the installed app. You can modify components, run tests, and experiment with data flows.

Theming system
- Goals: Support consistent color tokens and intuitive theme switching.
- Theme tokens: The system uses a set of color tokens for backgrounds, foregrounds, borders, and shadows. Tokens adapt automatically when the theme changes.
- Light theme: Bright surfaces, clear contrast, and accessible text colors.
- Dark theme: Deeper surfaces, reduced brightness, and preserved readability.
- Theme switcher: A toggle in the header lets users switch themes instantly. The switch affects all UI elements that read tokens from the ThemeContext.
- Token usage: Components pull colors and spacing values from a single theme source. This reduces drift across the UI when tokens change.
- Extensibility: You can add new themes by extending the token set and wiring a new toggle option. The theme system is designed to be incremental.

Multi-select component
- Purpose: Allow users to choose several options from a list.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigable with focus styles, ARIA attributes, and proper labeling.
- Features:
  - Searchable options: Users can filter the list as they type.
  - Select all: Quick toggle to choose every option.
  - Clear selections: One click to reset the selection.
  - Chips: Selected items appear as chips for a compact overview.
  - Tooltip hints: Hover to see more information about an option.
  - Grouping: Options can be grouped to improve scanning.
- Props and API:
  - options: Array<{ id, label, group?, description? }>
  - value: Array<string|number> – IDs of selected options
  - onChange: (newValue) => void
  - placeholder: string
  - isDisabled: boolean
  - isMulti: boolean (explicitly enables multi-select)
- Usage example:
  - import { MultiSelectTheme } from './components/MultiSelectTheme';
  - <MultiSelectTheme
      options={[{ id: 1, label: 'Red' }, { id: 2, label: 'Blue' }, { id: 3, label: 'Green' }]}
      value={[1, 3]}
      onChange={(ids) => console.log(ids)}
      placeholder="Pick colors..."
    />
- Implementation notes:
  - Combines a button-like control with a popover panel that lists options.
  - Uses a controlled value pattern to keep state predictable.
  - Applies theme tokens to ensure the control matches the current theme.

Data flow and API usage
- Axios integration:
  - A simple axios instance is created in src/services/apiClient.js.
  - The instance applies a base URL and a standard timeout.
  - Interceptors demonstrate common tasks such as adding auth headers and handling errors.
- Fake API:
  - The project includes a lightweight fake API in src/services/fakeApi.js.
  - It returns simulated data with a small delay to mimic real network latency.
  - This helps in testing UI behavior when data arrives slowly or when errors occur.
- Typical usage pattern:
  - Use axios to fetch a list of options for the multi-select.
  - Use the fake API during demonstrations or tests.
  - Bind fetched data to the MultiSelect component as the options prop.
- Example:
  - async function loadOptions() {
      const resp = await apiClient.get('/options');
      if (resp && resp.data) setOptions(resp.data);
    }
  - The example shows how the UI reacts to data arrival and how the selection state remains stable.

Styling and layout
- Tailwind CSS:
  - The project uses Tailwind for rapid styling.
  - Utility classes drive layout, color, and spacing.
  - Custom theme tokens are defined to align with the theming system.
- CSS approach:
  - Minimal custom CSS is used to keep the bundle small.
  - Where needed, small CSS modules are provided to fine-tune the look.
- Visual structure:
  - A clean header with a title, a theme toggle, and navigation.
  - A content area with a grid or flex layout to place the multi-select alongside other demo widgets.
  - Cards and panels use consistent shadows and rounded corners for a modern feel.

Routing and navigation
- Router:
  - React Router provides simple navigation between demo pages.
  - Each page demonstrates a different aspect: theming, multi-select usage, data flow, and small UI patterns.
- Links:
  - Internal links point to sections within the app for quick exploration.
  - External links to release assets or project docs can be added where relevant.
- Accessibility:
  - Landmarks and headings are used to improve navigation for screen readers.
  - Focus order is logical and predictable.

Accessibility and usability
- Keyboard support:
  - Users can open the multi-select with the keyboard, navigate options, and select items with the spacebar or enter key.
  - The theme switcher can be toggled with keyboard controls.
- ARIA attributes:
  - The multi-select has proper ARIA roles, like role="listbox" and aria-maria? labeling.
  - Each option uses aria-selected to reflect selection state.
- Color contrast:
  - The theme tokens ensure sufficient contrast in both light and dark ecosystems.
  - Tests verify that text is readable against background colors in all themes.
- Responsiveness:
  - The UI adapts to small screens with a compact layout.
  - The multi-select panel becomes scrollable on narrow devices.

Performance and testing
- Performance:
  - The multi-select renders efficiently even with many options.
  - Memoization patterns are used where appropriate to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Testing:
  - Basic unit tests cover core behaviors like selection, clearing, and token application.
  - Visual tests verify that theme tokens apply to key components.
  - End-to-end tests simulate user interactions to ensure the UI behaves as expected.

Development workflow
- Code structure:
  - Components are small and focused. Each component has a clear purpose.
  - State management uses Context for global state and props for local control.
- Naming conventions:
  - Files and variables use descriptive names with camelCase for JavaScript.
  - Component names use PascalCase.
- Git workflow:
  - Use feature branches for new components or ideas.
  - Write small, focused commits with messages that explain the change.
  - Open a pull request to have the changes reviewed and merged.

Customization and extension
- Theming:
  - Add new themes by extending token sets and wiring a toggle option.
  - Themes are stored as objects and passed through ThemeContext.
- UI customization:
  - The multi-select component can be extended with additional props for grouping, descriptions, or custom renderers.
  - You can replace or extend icons, chip styles, and panel layout with minimal changes.
- Data integration:
  - The axios client and fake API can be swapped with real endpoints.
  - The data shape can be adjusted without breaking the UI as long as the options prop matches expected shape.

API surface and components
- Core components:
  - ThemeProvider: Exposes theme and a toggle mechanism.
  - MultiSelectTheme: The main multi-select with theme-aware styling.
  - Header: Simple app header with branding and theme control.
- Reusable hooks:
  - useTheme: Read and set the current theme.
  - useData: Handle data loading with loading and error states.
  - useToast: Lightweight notification helper for quick feedback.
- Data contracts:
  - Option shape: { id, label, group?, description? }
  - Selected value: Array of option ids.
- Event contracts:
  - onChange: Receives the new array of selected ids.
  - onLoad: Optional callback when data loads.

State management patterns
- Local state:
  - The multi-select manages its own internal state for open/closed, search text, and current selection when uncontrolled.
- Global state:
  - Theme is stored in a context to ensure consistent styling across all components.
- Data flow:
  - Data flows from the API (or fake API) to the UI via props.
  - User actions push changes back through onChange callbacks to the parent or global state.
- Traceability:
  - Actions update state predictably. Each change is reflected in the UI immediately.

Security considerations
- Dependencies:
  - The project uses well-known libraries with active communities.
  - Regular updates reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities.
- Data handling:
  - Only mock data is used in the demo. Real server data should be sanitized and validated.
- Client-side security:
  - The app runs in the browser context. Do not rely on client-side validation for security-critical rules.

Debugging tips
- Console logs:
  - Place console logs in event handlers to verify state changes.
- Theme checks:
  - Change the theme and verify token values propagate to the UI.
- API failures:
  - Simulate API failures in the fake API to observe error handling behavior.
- Performance profiling:
  - Use browser dev tools to check render times and identify unnecessary re-renders.

Developer guidelines
- Start from the essentials:
  - Get the app running from the releases asset or by running from source.
  - Confirm the multi-select and theme switcher work as described.
